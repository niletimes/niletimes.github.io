**CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.** – Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman led the first-ever private spacewalk on Thursday, orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth in a mission organized by SpaceX.

Isaacman, along with his crew, conducted the spacewalk after their capsule was depressurized. Wearing SpaceX’s new spacewalking suits, they ventured outside to test the suits' durability in the harsh environment of space. The mission aimed to push forward developments for future space exploration, including potential settlement on Mars.

The spacewalk, which lasted about two hours, is part of Isaacman's ambitious Polaris Dawn program, one of three privately financed missions aimed at advancing space travel.

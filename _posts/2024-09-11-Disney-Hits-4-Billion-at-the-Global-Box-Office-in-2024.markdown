Walt Disney Studios has crossed a significant global box office milestone in 2024, raking in over $4 billion. This achievement was largely fueled by the tremendous success of two blockbuster films: *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine*. Both movies, though catering to different demographics, have together grossed nearly $3 billion globally. Disney has also maintained its dominance domestically, generating over $1.2 billion in revenue this year.

### *Inside Out 2* – Breaking Animated Film Records

*Inside Out 2*, the sequel to Pixar's beloved original, has made an extraordinary impact at the global box office, amassing a staggering $1.675 billion. This makes it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the biggest animated release of all time, surpassing even *Jurassic World* to become the eighth-highest-grossing film in history. Domestically, it has raked in over $650 million, securing a spot in the top 11 highest-grossing films of all time in the U.S.

The success of *Inside Out 2* represents a triumphant return for Pixar, which has struggled in recent years. The movie has resonated with both critics and audiences, holding a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 95% audience score.

### *Deadpool & Wolverine* – Marvel's R-Rated Blockbuster

In contrast to the family-friendly *Inside Out 2*, *Deadpool & Wolverine* has captured the attention of more mature audiences, earning $1.29 billion globally so far. This makes it the second-biggest film of 2024 and the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. The film has revived interest in the Marvel brand after a somewhat disappointing post-pandemic performance and stands as the most successful project in the careers of both Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.

Despite its more niche appeal, *Deadpool & Wolverine* has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 79% with a 95% audience rating. Its success proves that Disney can balance diverse genres while achieving box office gold.

### Other Box Office Performances: *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* and *Alien: Romulus*

While *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine* took the lead, Disney also saw success with other films, such as *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* and *Alien: Romulus*. *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* has earned nearly $400 million worldwide, while *Alien: Romulus* has crossed the $300 million mark globally. Both films were developed by 20th Century Studios, which Disney inherited during its acquisition.

These films have contributed significantly to Disney’s box office dominance in 2024, proving the value of Disney’s diverse slate of inherited franchises.

### Disney's Upcoming Releases – More Hits on the Horizon

Disney’s successful year is far from over. The studio is preparing for the holiday season with two major releases: *Moana 2* and *Mufasa: The Lion King*. Given the immense popularity of their predecessors, Disney is anticipating that these films will add further billions to their box office total. Both films have already generated high expectations among audiences and analysts alike.

If these films perform as well as predicted, Disney could finish 2024 with multiple billion-dollar releases, further solidifying its dominance at the global box office.

### Disney Continues Its Dominance at the Global Box Office

2024 marks the third consecutive year that Disney has crossed the $4 billion global box office mark. This achievement comes as no surprise given Disney’s track record of producing films that cater to diverse audiences, from animated hits like *Inside Out 2* to action-packed superhero films like *Deadpool & Wolverine*.

As the first studio to reach this milestone in 2024, Disney continues to demonstrate its unmatched ability to capture the global audience's imagination. This is the tenth time Disney has reached the $4 billion threshold since 2010, underscoring the company's sustained dominance in the entertainment industry.


### The Legacy of Disney's Acquired Franchises

Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Studios has proven to be a strategic move, as films like *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* and *Alien: Romulus* have become major contributors to its box office success. These inherited properties have helped diversify Disney’s portfolio, allowing the studio to continue breaking records across various genres.

The success of these films, alongside Disney’s core franchises, demonstrates the company’s ability to adapt and leverage its acquisitions for long-term success.



### Looking Forward: Disney's Path to Box Office Glory

As 2024 progresses, Disney is well-positioned to continue its box office reign. With *Inside Out 2* breaking records as the highest-grossing animated movie ever and *Deadpool & Wolverine* delivering massive returns, the studio’s diversified approach is paying off. The upcoming holiday season, featuring much-anticipated releases like *Moana 2* and *Mufasa: The Lion King*, is expected to propel Disney to even greater heights.

In addition, the resurgence of older franchises like *Coraline*, which recently saw a successful 15th-anniversary re-release, shows that Disney’s appeal spans generations and continues to evolve. The year 2024 may see Disney reach new, unprecedented milestones in the global entertainment industry.
